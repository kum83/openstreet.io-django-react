Next, you want the list of assets you would like to add to your holdings. You also need the weights for each assets that you are adding to the portfolio.

The annualized return formula is calculated as a geometric average to show what an investor would earn over a period of time if the annual return was compounded."},{qid:63,question:"What is Historical Risk and how is it computed? ",answer:"Historical Risk is the annualized risk over the last 5 years for the portfolio. A stock's risk is the variation in its price over a period of time. For example, one stock may have a tendency to swing wildly higher and lower, while another stock may move in much steadier, less turbulent way. Both stocks may end up at the same price at the end of day, but their path to that point can vary wildly. To present this volatility in annualized terms, we simply need to multiply our daily standard deviation by the square root of 252."},{qid:64,question:"What is Sharpe ratio and how is it computed?",answer:"The Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe and is used to help investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk."},{qid:65,question:"Why is Sharpe ratio important?",answer:"The Sharpe ratio can help explain whether a portfolio's excess returns are due to smart investment decisions or a result of too much risk. Although one portfolio or fund can enjoy higher returns than its peers, it is only a good investment if those higher returns do not come with an excess of additional risk."},{qid:66,question:"How is the Wealth Graph computed?
